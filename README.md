# Xamarin Forms & Microsoft Computer Vision API Sample
This is a simple tutorial that allows developers to understand how to consume MS Cognitive Services API using Xamarin.Forms.
This sample will just cover how to detect and extract handwritten text from an image.
# Prerequisites
* Install visual studio and the Xamarin package from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/fr/vs/).
* Get a subscription key in order to use the cognitive services api, make sure you select API Computer Vision from [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/try/cognitive-services/).
# Installation
Just clone/download the project and open it using VS studio. Then build and deploy.
# Usage
Simple!! Tap on the scan button, the camera will open, make sure you point it at an image containing text and then capture.

The app will send the photo the api and it will be processed. Every Second the app will send a request to the api to check if the result is ready and when it's done you will be redirected to the result page.
